Most of my recent work is under private repositories due to active collaborations and unpublished research.
Public repositories here (e.g., SEM_related, alignTK_modified, DeepLearningCoursera) are a small sample of my coding style and project structure.

If youâ€™d like to learn more about my machine learning, connectomics, or signal processing pipelines, please feel free to contact me directly for a summary or demo access.
