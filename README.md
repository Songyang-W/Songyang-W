<p align="center">PhD @ BU | Signal Processing | Neural Modeling | Wearable Interfaces</p>

Many of my current projects are maintained in private repositories as part of research collaborations and prototype development.
The public projects on this page show my coding style and documentation standards, but only reflect a portion of my work.

For more details about my signal processing, ML model evaluation, and large-scale data engineering projects, please contact me directly for summaries or demo materials.
